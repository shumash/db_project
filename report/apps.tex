\section{Applications}\label{sec:apps}

One of the appeals of this approximate patch-based approach
is that it naturally lends itself to applications. In this
section we describe methods to use our database for
two applications - duplicate detection (Sec.~\ref{ssec:dups})
and similar image retrieval (Sec.~\ref{ssec:retr}).
