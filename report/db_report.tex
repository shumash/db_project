% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{4} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
We present a novel strategy for patch-based lossy compression which exploits the inevitable redundancy found in large image collections.  We describe a scalable PostgreSQL-based implementation leveraging the indexing infrastructure found in relational DBMS.  We decompose images into sets of \emph{patches} which we define to be small contiguous subregions of images.  Since many image textures (e.g. sky, ocean, forest, walls, etc.) are ubiquitous in image datasets, rather than store all the information of these patches for every image, we only store pointers to approximating patches in a \emph{patch dictionary}.  This dictionary is grown in an online fashion as new images are added, in the case where no similar-enough patch can currently be found in the database under our chosen patch distance function.  In order to efficiently retrieve patches from our database, we make use of Locality-Sensitive Hashing and a number of key optimizations.  We analytically compute the savings of our compression scheme, and experimentally demonstrate its performance over various image categories of the large SUN 2012 database. Finally, we provide subjective and quantitative evaluations of our compression quality.
